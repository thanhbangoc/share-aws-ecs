# Contributing

We love your input to improve our project. All contributions to this project are welcomed.
Contributions can be in any of these form:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Discussing a feature/function
- Proposing new features

## Reporting bugs

We use Gitlab's [issues](https://gitlab.com/thanhbadev/hello-world/-/issues) to track public bugs.
Report a new bug by opening a new issue and label it as Bug.

### Write bug reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Try to be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried but didn't work)

## Submitting a fix

We use [GitLab-Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) to manage our repository and work flow.
TL;DR:

1. Clone the project and create your own branch from 'develop'
2. Start making changes via commits (with associated messages)
3. Open a Merge Request
4. Merge Request will be reviewed by Owner/Maintainers and considered adding to the next release
5. Deploy and test
6. Merge to `release`/`master`

**Note**:

- Please refer to [README](https://gitlab.com/thanhbadev/hello-world/-/blob/master/README.md) for details on how to run the project locally and sneak peak of our coding standard and expectations.

## Discussing/Proposing features

Discussion can also be carried by Gitlab's [issues](https://gitlab.com/thanhbadev/hello-world/-/issues) with appropriate tags and/or emailing to owner/maintainers
